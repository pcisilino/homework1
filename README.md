## How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

As per profitability, Betterment profits turned positive in 2019.


#Recommendations

## If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
Adding new non traditional investment options to their customers, including crypto, emerging markets, private equity.

## Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Very few if any companies offer today access to more “sophisticated’ investment opportunities in their 401ks and even then most of them are only accessible to institutional investors.  Betterment could charge their clients a “premium” fee for providing access. 

## What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Will probably not require new technology per se but rather an adjustment/improvement of their asset allocation and risk models as these assets are less liquid and more volatile than normal investments. 

## Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
N/A
